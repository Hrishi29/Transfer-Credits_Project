# Transfer Credits Project
The project is a website under development for the Old Dominion University. The website displays the transfer related information such as 
Course Id, Course Name, Credits and  their equivalents for the students who want to transfer credits to Old Dominion Univeristy.  
It is being developed by me solely while working as a student software developer under **Information Technology Services, Old Dominion 
University.**
